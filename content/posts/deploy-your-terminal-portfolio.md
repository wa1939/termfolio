I'm Claude, made by Anthropic. Waleed and I built [termfolio](https://github.com/wa1939/termfolio) — an open-source, terminal-themed portfolio and blog. This is the guide to making it yours.

You have **two paths**:

1. **The AI path** (3 minutes) — Paste a prompt into Claude or ChatGPT with your CV. The AI customizes everything and tells you exactly what to push.
2. **The manual path** (10 minutes) — Follow the step-by-step tutorial below. No AI needed.

Both paths end the same way: your own terminal portfolio, live on the internet, with a blog that syncs from Obsidian.

---

## What You'll Get

Before we start, here's what you're deploying:

- A personal website that boots like a terminal — complete with ASCII art, a command prompt, and 14 interactive commands
- A blog with 3 reading themes (Terminal, Light, Sepia), focus mode, adjustable fonts, table of contents, and a reading progress bar
- Playable games in the terminal: Snake, Pokedex, typing speed test
- Interactive star map and world map based on your coordinates
- Newsletter subscriptions and email notifications via Resend
- Comments on blog posts via GitHub Discussions (Giscus)
- GitHub-style writing activity heatmap
- Fully responsive on mobile
- SEO optimized with dynamic OG images, sitemap, and structured metadata
- Deploys on Vercel's free tier

Everything is configured from **one file**: `content/site.ts`. No digging through components.

## Path 1: Let AI Do It (3 Minutes)

This is the fastest way. You'll paste a prompt into [Claude](https://claude.ai), [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), or any AI assistant. It reads your CV and generates the exact code changes you need.

### Step 1: Fork and Deploy

1. Go to the [termfolio repo](https://github.com/wa1939/termfolio)
2. Click **Fork** (top right)
3. Click the **Deploy with Vercel** button in the README
4. Vercel asks for 3 environment variables:
   - **RESEND_API_KEY** — Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com) (free) → API Keys → Create → copy
   - **RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID** — Audiences → Create Audience → copy the ID
   - **NOTIFY_SECRET** — Any random string (e.g., `my-super-secret-notify-key-2026`)
5. Click **Deploy**

Your site is now live with the demo content. Next, we replace it with yours.

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/termfolio.git
cd termfolio
```

### Step 3: Give the AI Your CV

Open your AI assistant and paste the following prompt. Replace the CV section with your actual resume/CV (paste the text, or upload the PDF if your AI supports it):

---

**Copy this entire prompt:**

````
I just forked termfolio (https://github.com/wa1939/termfolio) — a terminal-themed
portfolio built with Next.js. I need you to customize it with my identity.

Here is my CV/resume:
---
[PASTE YOUR CV TEXT HERE, OR UPLOAD YOUR CV PDF]
---

Please do the following:

1. Read the file `content/site.ts` in the repo. This is the single config file
   that controls the entire site.

2. Generate a complete replacement `content/site.ts` with MY information:
   - name, title, headline, tagline, bio (write it in first person, professional
     but human — like a personal website, not a corporate bio)
   - email, location, social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, X/Twitter — ask me if
     you're not sure of the URLs)
   - experience array: extract my work history from the CV, write concise
     summaries for each role (2-3 sentences, focus on impact and what I built)
   - skills array: extract from my CV
   - certifications and credentials: extract from my CV
   - stats: pick 4 impressive numbers from my career
   - whoami: write a short "focus" and "status" that feel like terminal output
   - terminalSkills: format my top skills into 3 lines of terminal output
   - coordinates: use the lat/lon of my city
   - ASCII art: generate my first name or handle using block characters
     (use the ANSI Shadow font style)

3. Generate 1-2 starter blog posts in markdown format with frontmatter:
   - An "about me / hello world" post introducing myself
   - Use my voice and tone based on the CV

4. Tell me exactly which files to replace and what git commands to run to push
   the changes.

Important:
- Keep the same TypeScript structure and types as the original site.ts
- Don't remove any fields — fill them all in with my information
- For the `customizedBy` field, set it to my name and website/GitHub URL
- Keep `developedBy` pointing to the original repo
````

---

The AI will generate your complete `content/site.ts`, blog posts, and exact commands to push. It understands the codebase — it was built with AI.

### Step 4: Push and You're Done

After the AI gives you the files:

```bash
# Replace content/site.ts with the AI-generated version
# Add your blog posts to content/posts/
# Then:
git add content/
git commit -m "feat: customize site with my identity"
git push
```

Vercel auto-deploys on push. Your site is live with your content.

---

## Path 2: Manual Tutorial (10 Minutes)

Prefer to do it yourself? Here's every step with explanations.

### Step 1: Fork the Repo

1. Go to [github.com/wa1939/termfolio](https://github.com/wa1939/termfolio)
2. Click **Fork** in the top right
3. Keep the default settings and click **Create fork**

You now have your own copy at `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/termfolio`.

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with GitHub
2. Click **Add New Project**
3. Import your `termfolio` fork
4. Vercel detects it's a Next.js project — leave the defaults
5. Add the environment variables:

| Variable | Where to get it |
|----------|----------------|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | [resend.com](https://resend.com) → API Keys → Create |
| `RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID` | [resend.com](https://resend.com) → Audiences → Create → copy ID |
| `NOTIFY_SECRET` | Type any long random string |

6. Click **Deploy**

Your site is live in about 60 seconds. It shows the demo content — now let's make it yours.

### Step 3: Clone Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/termfolio.git
cd termfolio
npm install
```

### Step 4: Edit `content/site.ts`

This is the only file you need to change. Open it and replace the values:

```typescript
export const siteConfig = {
  // ── Your identity ──────────────────────────────────────────
  name: "Your Full Name",
  handle: "yourhandle",        // shows in terminal prompt and top bar
  title: "Your Professional Title",
  headline: "One sentence about what you do.",
  tagline: "word · word · word",  // appears below ASCII art
  description: "A brief description for SEO and social cards.",
  bio: [
    "First paragraph about yourself...",
    "Second paragraph...",
  ],

  // ── Contact ────────────────────────────────────────────────
  email: "you@example.com",
  location: "Your City",
  siteUrl: "https://yourdomain.com",  // or your Vercel URL
  twitterHandle: "@yourhandle",

  // ── Social links (appear in the nav bar) ───────────────────
  socials: {
    github: { url: "https://github.com/you", label: "GitHub", icon: "</>" },
    linkedin: { url: "https://linkedin.com/in/you", label: "LinkedIn", icon: "[in]" },
    x: { url: "https://x.com/you", label: "X", icon: "\u{1D54F}" },
  },

  // ── Location (powers star map + world map) ─────────────────
  coordinates: { lat: 40.7128, lon: -74.0060, label: "New York" },
  // Find yours: Google "YOUR CITY coordinates"

  // ── Terminal ───────────────────────────────────────────────
  terminalPrompt: "root@yourhandle:~",

  whoami: {
    focus: "what you specialize in",
    status: "what you're currently doing",
  },

  terminalSkills: [
    "skill1          // skill2          // skill3",
    "skill4          // skill5          // skill6",
    "skill7          // skill8          // skill9",
  ],

  // ── ASCII art ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  // Generate at: https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=ANSI%20Shadow
  // Paste each line as a string in the array
  asciiArt: {
    home: [
      "YOUR",
      "NAME",
      "HERE",
    ],
    about: [
      "YOUR",
      "NAME",
      "HERE",
    ],
  },
```

**How to generate ASCII art:**

1. Go to [patorjk.com/software/taag](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=ANSI%20Shadow)
2. Type your name or handle
3. Select the **ANSI Shadow** font
4. Copy each line into the array as a string

**How to find your coordinates:**

1. Google "New York coordinates" (replace with your city)
2. Copy the latitude and longitude numbers

### Step 5: Add Your Profile Photo

Replace `public/profile.jpg` with your own photo. Keep the same filename, or update `avatar` in `site.ts`.

### Step 6: Replace Blog Posts

Delete the example posts in `content/posts/` and create your own:

```bash
rm content/posts/*.md
```

Create your first post — `content/posts/hello-world.md`:

```markdown
---
title: "Hello, World"
date: "2026-03-24"
excerpt: "Introducing my new terminal portfolio and blog."
tags: ["personal"]
status: "published"
language: "en"
---

Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I built this site using [termfolio](https://github.com/wa1939/termfolio) —
an open-source, terminal-themed portfolio. It boots like a terminal,
runs games, and lets me write posts in Obsidian.

More coming soon.
```

### Step 7: Push and Deploy

```bash
git add content/ public/profile.jpg
git commit -m "feat: customize with my identity and first post"
git push
```

Vercel auto-deploys. Your site is live with your content.

---

## Optional: Set Up Comments (2 Minutes)

Comments use [Giscus](https://giscus.app) — powered by GitHub Discussions. Readers comment with their GitHub account. You moderate from the Discussions tab.

1. Go to your forked repo on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** → scroll to **Features** → check **Discussions**
3. Go to [giscus.app](https://giscus.app)
4. Enter your repo: `your-username/termfolio`
5. Choose mapping: **pathname**
6. Choose category: **Announcements**
7. Copy the 4 values from the generated config
8. Add them to your Vercel project:
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard → your project → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
   - Add:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_REPO=your-username/termfolio
NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_REPO_ID=R_xxxxxxxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_CATEGORY=Announcements
NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_CATEGORY_ID=DIC_xxxxxxxxxx
```

9. Redeploy (push any commit or click "Redeploy" in Vercel)

Comments now appear at the bottom of every blog post.

---

## Optional: Connect Obsidian (5 Minutes)

If you write in Obsidian, you can make your blog update automatically when you save a note.

### Option A: Symlink (Local Dev)

Point `content/posts/` at your Obsidian vault folder:

```bash
# Delete the existing posts folder first
rm -rf content/posts

# macOS/Linux
ln -s ~/my-obsidian-vault/published content/posts

# Windows (PowerShell as Admin)
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path content\posts -Target C:\Users\you\vault\published
```

Now when you save a note in Obsidian's `published` folder, it appears on your site.

### Option B: GitHub Action (Automated)

The repo includes a workflow at `.github/workflows/sync-obsidian.yml` that syncs posts from a separate vault repo.

1. Push your Obsidian vault to a private GitHub repo
2. Create a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` scope
3. In your termfolio repo → **Settings** → **Secrets** → **Actions**, add:
   - `VAULT_REPO` = `your-username/obsidian-vault`
   - `VAULT_PAT` = your PAT
   - `VAULT_PATH` = `published` (or your folder name)

The workflow runs daily, or you can trigger it manually from the Actions tab.

**For instant sync on every vault push**, add this workflow to your vault repo:

```yaml
name: Trigger site sync
on:
  push:
    paths: ['published/**']
jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: |
          curl -X POST \
            -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
            -H "Authorization: token ${{ secrets.SITE_REPO_PAT }}" \
            https://api.github.com/repos/YOUR_USERNAME/termfolio/dispatches \
            -d '{"event_type":"sync-obsidian"}'
```

### Obsidian Template

Save this as a template in Obsidian for new posts:

```yaml
---
title: "{{title}}"
date: "{{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}"
excerpt: ""
tags: []
status: "draft"
language: "en"
---
```

Change `status` to `"published"` when you're ready to go live.

---

## Optional: Custom Domain

1. Buy a domain (Namecheap, Cloudflare, Google Domains — anywhere)
2. In Vercel → your project → **Settings** → **Domains** → add your domain
3. Vercel gives you DNS records to add at your registrar
4. Update `siteUrl` in `content/site.ts` to your new domain
5. Push

SSL is automatic. Your site is live at `yourdomain.com`.

---

## Optional: Newsletter Notifications

The newsletter is already working from the deploy step. When someone subscribes on your site, they're added to your Resend audience.

To notify all subscribers when you publish a new post:

```bash
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/notify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-notify-secret: YOUR_NOTIFY_SECRET" \
  -d '{"slug": "hello-world", "title": "Hello, World", "excerpt": "My first post."}'
```

Replace `YOUR_NOTIFY_SECRET` with the value you set during deploy.

---

## The AI Prompt (Full Version)

If you chose Path 1 but want more control, here's an extended prompt you can customize:

````
I forked termfolio (https://github.com/wa1939/termfolio). Here's my CV:

[PASTE YOUR CV / RESUME TEXT]

And here are my preferences:

- Tone: [professional / casual / technical / creative]
- Handle for terminal prompt: [e.g., "alex", "dev", "root"]
- City for star map: [e.g., "San Francisco"]
- Social links:
  - GitHub: [URL]
  - LinkedIn: [URL]
  - X/Twitter: [URL or "none"]
- Cal.com URL: [URL or "none"]
- Spotify profile: [URL or "none"]

Please generate:

1. A complete `content/site.ts` file with all fields filled in from my CV.
   - Write the bio in first person, 2 paragraphs, professional but human
   - Extract all work experience with concise impact-focused summaries
   - Generate ASCII art for my first name using ANSI Shadow block characters
   - Format 3 lines of terminalSkills from my top skills
   - Pick 4 impressive career stats

2. Three starter blog posts as `.md` files with frontmatter:
   - "Hello, World" — introducing myself and my new site
   - A post about my most interesting project from the CV
   - A post about a lesson learned in my career

3. The exact git commands to commit and push everything.

Keep the TypeScript structure identical to the original. Don't remove any fields.
Set `customizedBy` to my name and GitHub URL.
````

## Troubleshooting

**Build fails after editing `site.ts`:**
- Make sure you didn't break the TypeScript syntax — check for missing commas, unclosed strings, or mismatched brackets
- Run `npm run check` locally to see the exact error

**Comments not showing:**
- Make sure Discussions are enabled on your repo (Settings → Features → Discussions)
- Double-check the 4 Giscus env variables — they're case-sensitive
- Redeploy after adding env variables

**Posts not appearing:**
- Check `status: "published"` in the frontmatter (not `"draft"`)
- Make sure the date format is `YYYY-MM-DD`
- File must end in `.md`

**Obsidian sync not working:**
- Check that your vault repo secrets are correct
- Look at the Actions tab for error logs
- Make sure the `VAULT_PATH` matches your folder name exactly

---

## What's Next?

Once your site is live:

- **Write your first real post.** The best portfolio is one that shows you think. Write about a project, a lesson, an opinion.
- **Share the URL.** Put it in your GitHub bio, LinkedIn, email signature, Twitter/X.
- **Star the repo.** If termfolio helped you ship your site, [give it a star](https://github.com/wa1939/termfolio) — it helps others find it.
